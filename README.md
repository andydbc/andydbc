<p>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Andy, a Generative Designer based in Montreal, Canada.</p>

<p>I graduated in 2013 with a Master in Computer Science from UniversitÃ© Lyon II. I have a robust background in the video game industry with over 10 years of experience at compagnies like Ubisoft and EA Motive.</p>

<p>Since 2019, I've embarked on a freelance journey, collaborating with teams at different studios around the world. This has led me to work with a wild range of technologies like Unity, C++, GLSL, JavaScript/Typescript and p5js.</p>

I'm always available for a quick chat, talk about projects and collaborations! Feel free to say hi at <a@andbc.co>
